# Banner Static

This build uses Tailwind, PostCSS, and Sergey (with a sprinkle of other things). The overall goal is to provid a STATIC html/css/js build of the new Baltimore Banner front-end, for consumption into React/ARC/partials. Onward!

## Installation

```bash
# Get all the stuff
$ npm install

# Run everything (Tailwind+PostCSS+Sergey) in dev mode
$ npm run dev
```

## Issues

If you have any problems, please feel free to contact Clark. Also know he's a frotend-end fellow, and might not be able to help with too much command line stuff.
